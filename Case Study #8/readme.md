## Case Study Questions
### Data Exploration and Cleansing
1. Modify `month_year` in `interest_metrics` to a date type with the start of the month.
2. Count records by `month_year` (sorted chronologically, with nulls first).
3. Address handling of null values in `interest_metrics`.
4. Identify `interest_id` values missing in either dataset.
5. Summarize record counts by `id` in `interest_map`.
6. Determine the appropriate join type and validate by examining `interest_id = 21246`.
7. Check if `month_year` values precede `created_at` in the joined table and validate these records.

### Interest Analysis
1. Identify interests present across all `month_year` dates.
2. Calculate the cumulative percentage of records starting at 14 months and determine the threshold for 90%.
3. Determine how many records would be removed based on the threshold in question 2.
4. Evaluate the business implications of removing these records.
5. Count unique interests per month after filtering.

### Segment Analysis
1. Find the top 10 and bottom 10 interests with the highest composition values, including their corresponding `month_year`.
2. Identify the 5 interests with the lowest average ranking.
3. Find the 5 interests with the largest standard deviation in `percentile_ranking`.
4. Analyze the variability in `percentile_ranking` for these interests.
5. Provide a customer segmentation overview and recommend products/services to target.

### Index Analysis
1. Calculate average composition values and identify the top 10 interests by month.
2. Determine which interests appear most frequently in the top 10.
3. Compute the average of the top 10 compositions per month.
4. Perform a 3-month rolling average of the maximum average composition from September 2018 to August 2019.
5. Analyze potential causes for fluctuations in maximum average composition.
